# RetroLite

This is a libretro frontend implementation. I'm not trying to compete with RetroArch, but I would like to try
some things that most likely will never be part of said project. RetroArch is excellent at what it does and if
that works for you, then use it. I'll populate this as I work on the project and add features.

# Software used

This software depends on several libraries to work. Most of them are included as LFS files in order to make it
simple to work with this. I include the list below with links to their respective websites. I don't own any of them
and if you are the owner of one of them and want me to remove the source and/or binaries from this repository, let
me know and I will comply ASAP. 

My code is licensed with the GPL-3 license, however, I'm not relicensing any part of the code that does not belong
to me. I'm including a LICENSE file inside every subfolder that does not belong to my code and I'm including the
license here in the root as well. I'm not a lawyer so if I'm doing something wrong, please let me know and I'll
correct it.
